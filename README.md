This repostory contains matlab code to solve a set of partial differential equations

The full set of equations can be found in the appendix of my DPhil thesis

First, select your wavelength and depth of focus into the diamond. Select your aberration correction and then run

Intensity_calc.m

Then run PDEfull.m

THis will take some time.


There is more code to be added to calculate the photoionisation lookup table but this is currently on my old computer. Will add in near future
